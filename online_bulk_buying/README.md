### Introduction
This project is for bulk placing an order on a website, Bestbuy.ca and XBOX are used as an example. It does the follwoing steps:
- Open Chrome and navigate to teh website 
- Clear existing items in shopping cart if any (mostly definitely no because this is a brand new instance of Chrome, but just to be sure)
- Search for items in the search bar
- Locate the item and add to cart
- Place an order once all items are added
- The program will stop at the payment page to allow user to proceed

:exclamation: For providing some ideas only, almost certain some tweeks of xpath are needed for different websites :exclamation:
